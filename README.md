# ETHER DREAM  


[http://www.etherdream.io](http://www.etherdream.io) 

Simple project in HTML5 using current transactions on the Ethereum blockchain to generate ambient art and music. Utilizing [etherchain](http:/www.etherchain.org)'s API, [tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) and [three.js](https://threejs.org/) under the hood and with design inspiration from [bitbonkers](https://bitbonkers.com/).

Send some ether to the address on the page and some more notes play.

This is currently NOT WORKING, as etherchain have removed their API. When time is available I want to update to a new API or launch my own node.
