# ETHER DREAM  


[http://www.etherdream.io](http://www.etherdream.io) 

Simple project in HTML5 using current transactions on the Ethereum blockchain to generate ambient art and music. Utilizing [etherchain](http:/www.etherchain.org)'s API, [tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) and [three.js](https://threejs.org/) under the hood and with design inspiration from [bitbonkers](https://bitbonkers.com/).

The app is currently producing dummy data, and is in effect a browser-based ambient music box, until we can find a new API or find the time to launch our own ether node.
